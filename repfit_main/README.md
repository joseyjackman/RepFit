# repfit_main

An advanced fitness tracker! (with a damn-nice interface)


#"videos" for tutorials or other examples will be added via .gif format as i had terrible issues with both 404 errors and some https related issues attempting to embed youtube videos and when i did get them working it was both unnecessarily slow and hard to integrate.
